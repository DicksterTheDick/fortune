## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- A `card_meanings.json` file containing your deck's cards and their meanings.

Example `card_meanings.json` format:
```json
{
  "[A♥]": "Love and happiness. The home, a love letter. This card is a particularly favorable card that indicates troubles and problems lifting.",
  "[K♥]": "A fair-haired man with a good nature; or a man with Water signs predominating in his chart. Fair, helpful advice. Affectionate, caring man. This man helps you out without much talk. His actions reveal his kindness and concern.",
  "[Q♥]": "A fair-haired woman with a good nature; or a woman with Water signs predominating in her chart. Kind advice. Affectionate, caring woman. Sometimes, this card can indicate the mother or a mother figure.",
  "[J♥]": "A warm-hearted friend. A fair-haired youth; or a young person with Water signs predominating in his or her chart. Often this points to a younger admirer."
}
```

> **Note:** This is a small snippet. The full file includes all 52 cards.
